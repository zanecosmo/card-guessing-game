# Guess It
A game where the player is given a topic as a prompt, and they must type in words associated with that given topic. If that word matches with one of the acceptable words in the topic-list the word is revealed from underneath a card, and the player gets a point.

My purpose for this project:
* learn the basic concepts of ReactJS, including state, components, JSX and props.
* practice using CSS for more interactive on-screen elements
* learn the basics of hosting a React-App

## Status
In development.

## About
My intention is to host the app on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/about) using an Express/Node.js back-end, but I may branch out and build a back-end with Python, Java, or C#. It uses the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) Javascript framework, SASS CSS preprocessor, in addition to standard HTML.
